      `An outlier with his skin perennially in the game, Ramesh is a
    proven risk-taker with a knack for building successes out of
    failures. He entered the industry over 25 years ago as a
    Scientist/Engineer at the Indian Space Research Organization
    (ISRO) in 1993. Over the years, he has worked with the world’s
    most leading MNCs as well as global tech and consulting firms
    like Infosys Limited, General Electric, Ernst & Young LLP,
    Wipro Systems, Intelligroup Inc and Genpact.`,
      `The last 15 years have seen Ramesh don the hats of several
    crucial leadership roles: as a Program Manager for large
    global transformation programs, Customer Account Manager with
    P&L responsibility, Practice Head for handling large practices
    that involve Oracle and SAP technologies, Competency Leader in
    incubating niche technologies, Quality Leader in driving
    6-Sigma and CMMI Initiatives, and as an AMS Head in setting
    customer GDC up.`,
      `With a penchant for architecting low-risk, high-return
    solutions, Ramesh is known for his innovative and decisive
    approach and has significant expertise in handling
    transformational programs and incubating Centres of
    Excellence. Known for his entrepreneurial mindset and
    cross-functional capabilities, it comes as no surprise that
    Ramesh decided to shift from the conventional IT journey and
    become the Founder-CEO at PGK Technologies Private Limited.
    With a passion for staying abreast of the latest developments
    in tech and understanding their applications — especially in
    blockchain, AI, and IoT — Ramesh garnered deep insights about
    how organizations can benefit from blockchain’s scalability,
    security, immutability, and P2P features, making it a natural
    choice for PGK Technologies.`,
